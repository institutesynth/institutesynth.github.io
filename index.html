                <p class="p-comment"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cKHwDXpErHTfMjxBC_PnZEA5GZ0Po0BC2a-Q89EWnrA/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Doc for you to edit and then send to me!</a></p>
                <p class="p-body">Under dull fluorescent lights and a thin divider barely creating separation at the same desk, my coworkers were copying and pasting the same email template, only replacing the name and number of pending data queries, fifty times. During the three hours they worked on this monotonous task, I thought about how to automate it through code: keep the template, but use a loop to pass in the unique names and numbers, and output the email to a text file that could be copied and pasted without any further input on their end. After numerous compiler errors and rewrites, I had the text file I wanted. The following day, the team had to repeat the same assignment for another set of data queries, and I offered to do it solo. Within 10 minutes, all 50 emails were sent out, and I reduced a two-person, three-hour task to a one-person job completed in minutes. My code continued to be used by my team for the task, and researchers were able to retrieve accurate data from the nationwide Long COVID RECOVER study for their projects. As I indirectly contributed to furthering our understanding of long COVID, I realized how much I was missing: the human stories behind the data, the lives beyond the numbers. I wanted to apply my work with data to directly improve health and shape their care in real-time. Thus, I traded lines of code for stories, patterned skirts for monotone scrubs, and became a medical scribe.</p>
                <p class="p-body">Each day in the Salem Emergency Department, I witnessed physicians honor patients' lives through diagnosis and treatments. One night, I translated for a Vietnamese-speaking man struggling with alcohol dependence, who frequently arrived at the ED intoxicated. As our eyes locked, he shared an earnest desire to quit drinking.  He revealed crucial information previously absent from his chart: originally from Saigon, he lived alone, depended on Social Security, and had no local family or support. This vital information, initially recorded in my notes, was soon integrated into social work and psychiatry plans, transforming their approach to his care by connecting him with local Vietnamese community resources such as the community center and Buddhist temple. I felt privileged assisting the physician, who allowed the patient to express his hardships without interruption and advocated for detox, which may not have been possible through a phone translator. Eventually, this patient — once a frequent presence in the ED — became a ghost of the past. Experiencing medicine practiced with compassion, focused not merely on symptoms but on personal struggles, identity, and stories, cemented my desire to practice medicine that honors patients' full lives, not just their symptoms. I aspire to carry forward this spirit of patient-centered care, connecting deeply with patients, and collaboratively guiding them toward healing.</p>
                <p class="p-body">I continued my commitment to comfort, attentive care, and honoring patients' stories into my hospice volunteering visits. One patient, "Shirley," and I bonded over our love for rough collies, as she used to have one named Teddy. Hoping to bring her some joy, I started bringing my collie along to my visits. Shirley and my dog adored each other instantly, with my dog often resting beside her. On days I visited without the dog, Shirley always asked for her - a reminder of how small gestures could touch a patient's final days.</p>
                <p class="p-body">As the weeks passed, Shirley's health declined. Recurrent UTIs left her more confused, and our conversations became quieter. Around Christmas, she passed away, and I no longer walked down the long, yellow-tinted corridors I had grown familiar with over the past year. Her passing showed me the bittersweet nature of hospice care: forming deep connections with patients, yet knowing their time is short.</p>
                <p class="p-body">Through bonding over trivia questions, listening to Bible readings, or silently holding hands with patients like Shirley, I learned to connect with patients beyond their diagnoses. Actively listening, responding thoughtfully, and tailoring comfort to their unique needs brought light to the patients' darkest days. Hospice work deepened my commitment to patient-centered care and honed in on skills that I will carry forward into every patient interaction.</p>
                <p class="p-body">Algorithms and data guide care, but healing begins in conversation. Patients can be reduced to symptoms and numbers, but dialogue restores the life behind soaring glucose levels or blood pressure values. Whether noticing a line to automate or bonding over collies, I have seen how small details can make a meaningful difference. I learned to meet people in their moments of need with attentiveness, empathy, and purpose. In turn, I made new friends and memories with my patients, but most importantly, showed up when they needed me. I intend to use both data and genuine conversation to guide care that focuses on the individual and their needs. Medicine rests on science but flourishes through human connection, and I am eager to unite these principles as a physician.</p>

                                <p>Every week, I help an immigrant from Vietnam learn to speak, read, and write English. Initially, he lived in America for 3 years unable to understand any English, but through the tutoring, he become more involved with the community, where he impressed his Adult Education teachers with his writing abilities, interviewed for the state's adult learning social media, and was featured multiple times in his school's paper. I planned lessons ahead of time and catered to what he wanted to work on. I enjoyed watching the student progress, connecting with them, and learning about their life and culture.</p>

                                <p>I directly observed and documented patient encounters within the ED. The position offered me an unparalleled vantage point beyond learning medical patterns and algorithms, extending into mentorship. The physicians were always eager to answer my questions, from their rationale about a patient to how their medical school rotations were structured. From witnessing the adrenaline-fueled high-stakes intubations to calming down distressed patients, I witnessed the full spectrum of healthcare, where humility and compassion were demonstrated and embodied by the doctors I observed, and I strive to reach their level of excellence.</p>

                                <p>I provided solace to patients facing their final six months through heartfelt conversations and shared laughter over games. One patient, "Leonne," who was limited to "yes/no" responses, still filled the room with joy when I asked about her hobbies, family, and pets. She'd grip my hands tighter after each goodbye, acknowledging our shared human journey towards life's conclusion - a journey she navigated with dignity and a profound sense of companionship. The privilege of being a part of my patients' final chapters shaped my approach toward medicine; I am committed to making sure every patient feels seen, heard, and valued, at any stage in their journey.</p>

                                <p>I contributed to a literature review concerning the different types of CSF parameters and their effects on the mechanisms and treatments of hydrocephalus. Within the realm of hydrocephalus treatment literature, a recurring cast of authors recycled their datasets in different papers, years apart. The illusion of promising results from my initial data collection quickly diminished upon re-examination of several papers, causing me to re-run code, regenerate graphs, and challenge previously statistically significant results. Research and medicine are filled with messy data, but with the keen eye and critical lens I’ve acquired, I feel prepared to navigate the fog.</p>

                                <p>I worked on the RECOVER project, which aims to understand long COVID; I preserved data integrity within the REDCap database by handling data queries, data entry, and participant-facing coordinator interactions. The data analysts added R to my ever-growing toolbox, teaching me to use a function to reduce 400 lines of redundant code into 15 lines. I contributed to the project's code base by writing some data queries for coordinators to correct, ensuring data quality. This environment of constant learning and innovation shaped my commitment to creating a culture of mentorship and continual growth for medical school and beyond.</p>

                                <p>As a clinical lab technologist in the BWH Clinical Microbiology Lab, my primary duty was performing microbiology assays, including gram stains and blood cultures, on patient samples sent from the OR, ED, inpatient floors, and outpatient clinics. Faced with recurrent questions or mistakes about certain procedures stemming from a lack of documentation or outdated SOPs, I started making flowcharts for the commonly asked issues. This led to reduced communication breakdowns and improved workflows. By taking the initiative, I was able to prioritize efficiency, clarity, and patient safety.</p>

                                <p>At the Boys And Girls Club, I tutored children from grades K-8 coming from disadvantaged backgrounds in reading, writing, and math. Every day in September, "Abby" arrived shrouded in gloom and silence, depending on me to decipher all the words and numbers on the homework. Through practice and application, along with our shared love of David Goggin's mantra of "refusing to die," she started acing her assignments. She also started working out at the club gym with the new friends she made. I saw her thrive academically and socially; as a physician, I want to do the same for my patients: champion their health and success, against all odds.</p>

                                <p>During my summer at Harvey Mudd, I upgraded a simplistic mathematical model of Type 1 Diabetes that merely focused on the pancreas to a more complete, complex one that added data on the blood and spleen using MATLAB. My work pioneered a newer, more complete model that included the liver. By tweaking and validating the model, I contributed to new, personalized approaches to the treatment of a complex disease. I am committed to continue using technology not only to treat diseases, but to change the way we think about healing and patient-centered care.</p>

                                <p>I used Python to refine datasets of protein-protein interactions for the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways then visualized the data in Cytoscape. My efforts unveiled a distinct lack of organization in glycolysis as opposed to OxPhos. This data served as evidence in a paper suggesting that more severe cancers have a higher Gibbs free energy value due to a reliance on glycolysis for energy. The findings call for novel drug targets against proteins favored by cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. I plan to continue applying computational methods to biology, in order to decipher the complexities of disease and pioneer new paths to medical innovation and healing.</p>

Leading 2D animation workshops, I taught animation principles and Adobe Animate, guiding members to bring their unique visions to life on their blank canvas. Membership increased from 5 to 30 members, and they left with pieces they are proud to have created and shared, with some even pursuing a minor in animation. With proof that challenging the status quo leads to unprecedented heights, I will continue to carve new paths from the established paths, to enhance patient care.</p>

                                    I explored the vast spectrum of medical care, from clean hospital rooms to the formalin-ridden, blood-soaked morgue. When I held the heart of a deceased patient, I faced the weight of what was at stake. To me, medicine is not just about diagnostics and treatments, but a vow to honor every breath and silence with equal reverence, and to stand at the edge of life and death with the knowledge and empathy.</p>

                                <p>I worked with a team to create a video game focused on improving mental health by being able to control the player's emotions using a home EEG device. The game dynamically adjusted difficulty based on the brainwaves read by the device, rewarding calmness with ease and agitation with challenge. The panelists, moved by our application, proceeded to award us the Brain And Development Prize at the Hackathon. My team of casual acquaintances evolved into a tight-knit group. Creating a patient-centered product inspired me to pursue medical research. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/focus-pocus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out the project!</a></p>

                                <p>As a novice who could barely ollie, I was grateful to find a diverse group of enthusiasts in the skateboarding club who saw my eagerness and welcomed me. Beyond landing new tricks such as bigspins, the excitement over small victories and the community kept me coming back, despite the wrist pain from falling the previous session. Through teamwork, club members landed tricks they never thought were possible. Thanks to the unwavering support from fellow skaters, I still skate to this day and help new skaters at the skatepark, and I wish to continue this spirit of unwavering support by uplifting my patients every step of the way.</p>

                <h3 class="essay-head">Medical Scribe</h3>
                <p class="essay-body">With the caffeine wearing off and the sun about to set, the doctor and I walked down the long corridors of the ED to see our last patient for the overnight shift. He came in for a psychiatric evaluation after his mother called the police on him. During the visit, the patient chronicled the many hardships that led him to the ED, from losing his job, to being kicked out of a homeless shelter. Not once did the doctor interrupt him or attempt to cut his story short. The interaction showed me that medicine isn't just about treating the disease, but also about humanity. When I was a patient, whether for a routine annual checkup or specialist visit, I often felt rushed and dismissed. These negative experiences distorted my view of medicine, where patients are just another paycheck for the doctors. However, the thorough and caring doctors I scribed for changed my jaded view of medicine from profit-driven care to patient-centric care. Through this patient interaction, I saw the type of doctor I wanted to be: one who listens and connects with patients and works with them to achieve their health goals by accounting for any factors which would limit their path.</p>

                <h3 class="essay-head">Clinical Research Coordinator II</h3>
                <p class="essay-body">At MGH Biostatistics, I noticed a fragmented atmosphere with missed opportunities for collaboration and camaraderie, evidenced by little interactions except for a "hi" exchanged in the hallways. After 6 months devoid of any team-building events, spurred by my colleagues' persistent encouragement, I took the initiative to organize a group dinner. That night, as I bonded with a coworker over our mutual passion for Skyrim and Mass Effect, I realized how personal connections could transcend professional boundaries and transform a working environment. As the department began to stick together like glue, I saw firsthand how fostering a cohesive team directly affected the department's output and continuity. We retained more staff, preserved invaluable institutional knowledge, and improved our overall efficiency. This experience cemented my belief in the power of interpersonal connections within professional medical settings. Effective patient care hinges not just on the competence of individual healthcare providers, but on their ability to communicate and collaborate seamlessly. Moving forward, I am committed to fostering strong, interconnected teams, ensuring that patient care is enhanced by deep, personal bonds among caregivers.</p>

                <h3 class="essay-head">Boys and Girls Club Volunteer</h3>
                <p class="essay-body">As I tutored a variety of kids at the "Club," I learned to adapt to different learning styles. Two students stood out. One was Sarah, with whom I helped with spelling homework and application of the new words in sentences. Initially, she felt it was acceptable to leave spelling errors within her sentences. However, when I introduced examples of corporate blunders that could have been avoided with a simple spell check, she began to see the real-world importance of her efforts. Recognizing her enjoyment of humor in learning, I made space for jokes and laughter in our lessons. This approach not only improved her academic performance but also enriched our interactions, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and empathy - qualities essential for a physician. I also assisted Diane, an eighth grader with an ambitious goal to become class president. Together, we analyzed how a successful criminal defense lawyer presents a case, gathers evidence, and incites objections. We then drafted a speech that helped her win the election. This experience taught me the effectiveness of connecting school concepts with real-life analogies and examples, enhancing my ability flexibility and adaptability in tutoring different age groups. These skills are akin to those required of a physician, who must adapt their explanations of medical complexities to patients.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><i>A little personal commentary:</i> I've actually wanted to mod longer than I have wanted to be a doctor, ever since I downloaded mods for Skyrim back in high school. Back then, there were not a lot of resources, and I went on to study science and learned how to sew and modify real clothes along the way instead. However, now there are even more mods than ever, and with that comes tutorials. After my 3rd MCAT, I launched Fallout 4 after not playing it for 5 years, and I had the itch to to make mods again. I watched various Youtube videos then began porting outfits from public XNALara models into Fallout 4 using tools such as 3DSMax and Outfit Studio. I learned a lot about 3D modelling from this and used software which honestly intimidated me for years. After debugging and playtesting, I share the mods for other people to enjoy.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><i>More personal commentary:</i> While studying for the MCAT, I had difficulty that brute forcing facts and making meaningless mneumonics to remember the memorizing amino acids, endocrine pathways, or the ever-so-dreadful metabolic pathways (like the Krebs Cycle). I found the resource Pixorize, which was originally created for medical school board exams, but they branched out to making MCAT videos as well. I would watch their videos and make Anki cards for them, and I found myself being able to recall the amino acids and pathways with ease. I created over 1000 Anki flashcards for all of Pixorize's 200 MCAT videos, and I supplemented the fields of these cards with an annotation of the whole Pixorize image that I made in Powerpoint, to reinforce the memory palace of an MCAT concept. The Anki deck is available for download on Reddit and AnkiHub, and I continue to maintain and update the deck through AnkiHub's syncing features.</p>
