                <h1 class="comment-head text-center">Personal Statement</h1>
                <p class="p-comment">I'm basically trying to say this is the field I want to study. I hope it's convincing enough.</p>
                <p class="p-body">The smooth cap of a ballpoint pen moves circularly around my arms, then shifts up and does the same circular motion. The man with the pen, a physician freshly off his shift from a major hospital in Saigon, sat knee to knee with me in his makeshift clinic on the first floor of his home, where moped parking meets Buddhist tributes, and medical inquiries were welcomed. Here, expertise flowed as freely as the traffic outside, for a nominal fee or none at all. As he demonstrated the distinctive pattern a parasite would leave behind if it were moving in my body, he explained that the mysterious red bumps on my arms lacked this pattern, suggesting they were most likely hives instead. Prior to this evaluation, back across in the world in America, I saw 2 specialists, had no allergy tests done, and was only told to take Zyrtec everyday. My dad's plea for a prescription of Phenergan fell on deaf ears, and they rushed us out of the room. Even though the origins of the hives remained elusive in Vietnam, the physician's willingness to share medical knowledge beyond the confines of the hospital and his close and genuine care remains etched in my memory, marking the first time I seriously considered medicine, and a breakaway from the profit-driven evaluations I was familiar with.</p>
                <p class="p-body">Shortly after arriving back to America, I was met with dread about the reality of finding a viable career path after college, when none of the jobs at the career fairs ignited any drive or flame within me. However, a wizard of computers, Professor Foley, taught my data structures class, always springing into action and writing a few lines of code to get the computer to follow his every whim whenever a student needed help with an assignment, whether it was making a linked list, or a loop for the snake game, or in my case, rewriting a whole code file to make a graph that took in two parameters. Other students praised him for being able to code anything, and seeing it time and time again, as well as his swift, yet crystal clear responses to student questions on Piazza, along his willingness to schedule meetings outside of his office hours, I wanted to be just like him: an expert in something with the heart of compassion and advocacy.</p>
                <p class="p-body">I continued down the path of computer science by taking an offer for the REU In Data Science program at Harvey Mudd College, hoping that I would walk away with a research topic that I'd be passionate enough to pursue for graduate school. At this summer program, I was standing at the intersection between mathematics, biology, and personalized medicine, integrating both science and technology, contributing to the field of Type I diabetes to help afflicted patients live longer and healthier by developing a mathematical model to create more personalized vaccine and therapeutic solutions than the current one-size-fits-all treatments for the life-long ailment. However, deep down, I wanted to do more than enhance lives by writing code in front of a laptop. I wanted to see and make connections with the data points on my computer screen, to touch lives directly.</p>
                <p class="p-body">My entry into patient care started in the hospital's 'blackbox,' known as the BWH Clinical Microbiology Lab, where patient samples came in, and results came out. There, I performed and interpreted critical microbiology tests such as blood cultures, acting as an unseen force that guided physicians on the next steps in the patient's care. While each sample narrated a tale of the patient's affliction and suffering, it was the same problem I had at Harvey Mudd: I yearned for greater involvement in patient care beyond mere samples and data points on the computer. Before long, I found myself a floor above my usual workspace, seated alongside Dr. Sholl and her trainees at the 8-headed microscope, which was exclusively reserved for pulmonary pathology signouts. We went through folder after folder, examining slide after slide tinted in shades of pink and purple. As we examined a left lung biopsy, a slide with a striking pink and purple circular morphology appeared. Suspecting a fungus ball, Dr Sholl had her fellow pull up the patient's chest X-Ray. She asked me if I knew how to read the film, and I admitted that I did not. However, she jumped up and explained how to read the opacities and pointed out all the abnormalities. I've seen this enthusiasm to explain in a crystal clear manner before, in Professor Foley always going into action diagnosing computer science issues, and in the doctor explaining parasitic infections back in Vietnam. At that moment, I realized that a physician was not just a healer, but also an educator. They mastered their craft, but they wanted to share it with the world and inspire new students to take the same path. I saw a future studying medicine and teaching it, and I wanted to explore it even more.</p>
                <p class="p-body">To plunge into the heart of medicine, I became a medical scribe, witnessing patient-physician interactions first-hand. Early on, I found myself struggling to keep up when physicians spoke Spanish, a language I had never studied. Determined to bridge this gap, I spent my free time to learning, and soon, I understood most conversations and was able to see native speakers' faces light up when I ask them questions in their language. Eventually, I helped translate for Vietnamese-speaking patients. A memorable encounter involved a Vietnamese-only speaking man who struggled with alcohol dependence and came to the ED every week intoxicated. When I translated for the patient, he shared his earnest desire to quit drinking. The depth of his plea, evident as our eyes locked and speaking in a defeated tone, might have been lost if a phone translator had been used. I never saw him ever again after that night, but the experience serves as a reminder of the crucial role of direct communication in healthcare. Watching a shared languages connect people cemented my drive to advocate for immigrant communities, ensuring they receive care that acknowledges not just their symptoms, but their struggles, identities, and stories.</p>
                <p class="p-body">On the other side of medicine, rather than observing stabilizing patients or life-saving treatments, I helped individuals navigate their final months through hospice volunteering. Inspired by the warmth and skills of physicians I observed, I learned to tailor my approach to meet each patient's unique needs. A patient who will always stay with me is "Shirley." We bonded over our love for rough collies, as she used to have one named Teddy. Recognizing an opportunity to bring her some joy, I started bringing my rough collie along to my visits. They both adored each other instantly, with my dog often resting in besides Shirley, and Shirley feeding her. When I did visited alone, Shirley would always ask for her - a reminder to how small gestures could profoundly touch a patient's final days. As her condition worsened, with recurrent UTIs leaving her to more frail and confused every week, I was reminded of the bitter-sweet nature of hospice care: forming deep connections with patients, yet knowing their time is limited. Despite the heartache of seeing friends pass away, hospice is not a failure or a limitation of medicine, but a profound act of human expression. I connected with patients through speaking with them and their families, absorbing their life story, and ensuring they felt heard, valued, and at peace in their final moments.</p>
                <p class="p-body">Shadowing dedicated physicians, enduring unpredictable nights scribing in the ED, and connecting with hospice patients transformed a simple curiosity into an active pursuit. I came to realize that medicine is more than just science: it is a human art that blends technical expertise with deep empathy, where each patient's story can fundamentally shift the approach to care. Through the guidance of my mentors, I am committed to embracing both the rigors and rewards of medicine, continously learning, innovating, and enriching the lives of my future patients and colleagues.</p>

                                <p>Every week, I help an immigrant learn to speak, read, and write English. I had a student who lived in America for 3 years, but was not able to speak English. Through the tutoring, he become more involved with the community, where he impressed his Adult Education teachers with his abilities, interviewed for their social media, and even give presentations to the whole school. As these 2-hour sessions were sometimes the only time the student would speak English for the week, I planned lessons ahead of time and researched the most effective study techniques. I enjoyed watching the student progress to be able to formulate sentences faster each session while connecting with them and learning more about their lives and culture.</p>

                                <p>I directly observed and documented patient encounters within the ED. The position offered me an unparalleled vantage point beyond learning medical patterns and algorithms, extending into mentorship. The physicians were always eager to answer my questions, from their rationale about a patient to how their medical school rotations were structured. From witnessing the adrenaline-fueled high-stakes intubations to calming down distressed patients, I witnessed the full spectrum of healthcare, where humility and compassion were demonstrated and embodied by the doctors I observed, and I strive to reach their level of excellence.</p>

                                <p>I provided solace to patients facing their final six months through heartfelt conversations and shared laughter over games. One patient, "Leonne," who was limited to "yes/no" responses, still filled the room with joy when I asked about her hobbies, family, and pets. She'd grip my hands tighter after each goodbye, acknowledging our shared human journey towards life's conclusion - a journey she navigated with dignity and a profound sense of companionship. The privilege of being a part of my patients' final chapters shaped my approach toward medicine; I am committed to making sure every patient feels seen, heard, and valued, at any stage in their journey.</p>

                                <p>I contributed to a literature review concerning the different types of CSF parameters and their effects on the mechanisms and treatments of hydrocephalus. Within the realm of hydrocephalus treatment literature, a recurring cast of authors recycled their datasets in different papers, years apart. The illusion of promising results from my initial data collection quickly diminished upon re-examination of several papers, causing me to re-run code, regenerate graphs, and challenge previously statistically significant results. Research and medicine are filled with messy data, but with the keen eye and critical lens I’ve acquired, I feel prepared to navigate the fog.</p>

                                <p>I worked on the RECOVER project, which aims to understand long COVID; I preserved data integrity within the REDCap database by handling data queries, data entry, and participant-facing coordinator interactions. The data analysts added R to my ever-growing toolbox, teaching me to use a function to reduce 400 lines of redundant code into 15 lines. I contributed to the project's code base by writing some data queries for coordinators to correct, ensuring data quality. This environment of constant learning and innovation shaped my commitment to creating a culture of mentorship and continual growth for medical school and beyond.</p>

                                <p>As a clinical lab technologist in the BWH Clinical Microbiology Lab, my primary duty was performing microbiology assays, including gram stains and blood cultures, on patient samples sent from the OR, ED, inpatient floors, and outpatient clinics. Faced with recurrent questions or mistakes about certain procedures stemming from a lack of documentation or outdated SOPs, I started making flowcharts for the commonly asked issues. This led to reduced communication breakdowns and improved workflows. By taking the initiative, I was able to prioritize efficiency, clarity, and patient safety.</p>

                                <p>At the Boys And Girls Club, I tutored children from grades K-8 coming from disadvantaged backgrounds in reading, writing, and math. Every day in September, "Abby" arrived shrouded in gloom and silence, depending on me to decipher all the words and numbers on the homework. Through practice and application, along with our shared love of David Goggin's mantra of "refusing to die," she started acing her assignments. She also started working out at the club gym with the new friends she made. I saw her thrive academically and socially; as a physician, I want to do the same for my patients: champion their health and success, against all odds.</p>

                                <p>During my summer at Harvey Mudd, I upgraded a simplistic mathematical model of Type 1 Diabetes that merely focused on the pancreas to a more complete, complex one that added data on the blood and spleen using MATLAB. My work pioneered a newer, more complete model that included the liver. By tweaking and validating the model, I contributed to new, personalized approaches to the treatment of a complex disease. I am committed to continue using technology not only to treat diseases, but to change the way we think about healing and patient-centered care.</p>

                                <p>I used Python to refine datasets of protein-protein interactions for the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways then visualized the data in Cytoscape. My efforts unveiled a distinct lack of organization in glycolysis as opposed to OxPhos. This data served as evidence in a paper suggesting that more severe cancers have a higher Gibbs free energy value due to a reliance on glycolysis for energy. The findings call for novel drug targets against proteins favored by cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. I plan to continue applying computational methods to biology, in order to decipher the complexities of disease and pioneer new paths to medical innovation and healing.</p>

                                <p>In response to the Animation Club's dwindling numbers, I stepped up as an officer, transforming it into a hub for both learning and celebrating animation by implementing classes and outings to local exhibitions. Leading 2D animation workshops, I taught animation principles and Adobe Animate, guiding members to bring their unique visions to life on their blank canvas. In revitalizing the club, membership increased from 5 to 30 members, and they left with pieces they are proud to have created and shared, with some even pursuing a minor in animation. With proof that challenging the status quo leads to unprecedented heights, I will continue to carve new paths from the established paths, to enhance patient care.</p>

                                    I explored the vast spectrum of medical care, from clean hospital rooms to the formalin-ridden, blood-soaked morgue. When I held the heart of a deceased patient, I faced the weight of what was at stake. To me, medicine is not just about diagnostics and treatments, but a vow to honor every breath and silence with equal reverence, and to stand at the edge of life and death with the knowledge and empathy.</p>

                                <p>I worked with a team to create a video game focused on improving mental health by being able to control the player's emotions using a home EEG device. The game dynamically adjusted difficulty based on the brainwaves read by the device, rewarding calmness with ease and agitation with challenge. The panelists, moved by our application, proceeded to award us the Brain And Development Prize at the Hackathon. My team of casual acquaintances evolved into a tight-knit group. Creating a patient-centered product inspired me to pursue medical research. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/focus-pocus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out the project!</a></p>

Beyond landing new tricks such as bigspins, the excitement over small victories and the community kept me coming back, despite the wrist pain from falling the previous session. Through teamwork, club members landed tricks they never thought were possible. Thanks to the unwavering support from fellow skaters, I still skate to this day and help new skaters at the skatepark, and I wish to continue this spirit of unwavering support by uplifting my patients every step of the way.</p>

                <h3 class="essay-head">Medical Scribe</h3>
                <p class="essay-body">With the caffeine wearing off and the sun about to set, the doctor and I walked down the long corridors of the ED to see our last patient for the overnight shift. He came in for a psychiatric evaluation after his mother called the police on him. During the visit, the patient chronicled the many hardships that led him to the ED, from losing his job, to being kicked out of a homeless shelter. Not once did the doctor interrupt him or attempt to cut his story short. The interaction showed me that medicine isn't just about treating the disease, but also about humanity. When I was a patient, whether for a routine annual checkup or specialist visit, I often felt rushed and dismissed. These negative experiences distorted my view of medicine, where patients are just another paycheck for the doctors. However, the thorough and caring doctors I scribed for changed my jaded view of medicine from profit-driven care to patient-centric care. Through this patient interaction, I saw the type of doctor I wanted to be: one who listens and connects with patients and works with them to achieve their health goals by accounting for any factors which would limit their path.</p>

                <h3 class="essay-head">Clinical Research Coordinator II</h3>
                <p class="essay-body">At MGH Biostatistics, I noticed a fragmented atmosphere with missed opportunities for collaboration and camaraderie, evidenced by little interactions except for a "hi" exchanged in the hallways. After 6 months devoid of any team-building events, spurred by my colleagues' persistent encouragement, I took the initiative to organize a group dinner. That night, as I bonded with a coworker over our mutual passion for Skyrim and Mass Effect, I realized how personal connections could transcend professional boundaries and transform a working environment. As the department began to stick together like glue, I saw firsthand how fostering a cohesive team directly affected the department's output and continuity. We retained more staff, preserved invaluable institutional knowledge, and improved our overall efficiency. This experience cemented my belief in the power of interpersonal connections within professional medical settings. Effective patient care hinges not just on the competence of individual healthcare providers, but on their ability to communicate and collaborate seamlessly. Moving forward, I am committed to fostering strong, interconnected teams, ensuring that patient care is enhanced by deep, personal bonds among caregivers.</p>

                <h3 class="essay-head">Boys and Girls Club Volunteer</h3>
                <p class="essay-body">As I tutored a variety of kids at the "Club," I learned to adapt to different learning styles. Two students stood out. One was Sarah, with whom I helped with spelling homework and application of the new words in sentences. Initially, she felt it was acceptable to leave spelling errors within her sentences. However, when I introduced examples of corporate blunders that could have been avoided with a simple spell check, she began to see the real-world importance of her efforts. Recognizing her enjoyment of humor in learning, I made space for jokes and laughter in our lessons. This approach not only improved her academic performance but also enriched our interactions, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and empathy - qualities essential for a physician. I also assisted Diane, an eighth grader with an ambitious goal to become class president. Together, we analyzed how a successful criminal defense lawyer presents a case, gathers evidence, and incites objections. We then drafted a speech that helped her win the election. This experience taught me the effectiveness of connecting school concepts with real-life analogies and examples, enhancing my ability flexibility and adaptability in tutoring different age groups. These skills are akin to those required of a physician, who must adapt their explanations of medical complexities to patients.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><i>A little personal commentary:</i> I've actually wanted to mod longer than I have wanted to be a doctor, ever since I downloaded mods for Skyrim back in high school. Back then, there were not a lot of resources, and I went on to study science and learned how to sew and modify real clothes along the way instead. However, now there are even more mods than ever, and with that comes tutorials. After my 3rd MCAT, I launched Fallout 4 after not playing it for 5 years, and I had the itch to to make mods again. I watched various Youtube videos then began porting outfits from public XNALara models into Fallout 4 using tools such as 3DSMax and Outfit Studio. I learned a lot about 3D modelling from this and used software which honestly intimidated me for years. After debugging and playtesting, I share the mods for other people to enjoy.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><i>More personal commentary:</i> While studying for the MCAT, I had difficulty that brute forcing facts and making meaningless mneumonics to remember the memorizing amino acids, endocrine pathways, or the ever-so-dreadful metabolic pathways (like the Krebs Cycle). I found the resource Pixorize, which was originally created for medical school board exams, but they branched out to making MCAT videos as well. I would watch their videos and make Anki cards for them, and I found myself being able to recall the amino acids and pathways with ease. I created over 1000 Anki flashcards for all of Pixorize's 200 MCAT videos, and I supplemented the fields of these cards with an annotation of the whole Pixorize image that I made in Powerpoint, to reinforce the memory palace of an MCAT concept. The Anki deck is available for download on Reddit and AnkiHub, and I continue to maintain and update the deck through AnkiHub's syncing features.</p>
